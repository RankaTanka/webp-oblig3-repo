This is a project regarding input validation and implementation. It consists of a locally hosted website where you can choose a movie, and write a number of tickets and some pruchase information and register it if it's valid. It has some different functions that are explained below

## Installation
Download the zip-file from github and unzip it where you see fit. Then choose a preffered browser and open index.html in it.

## Registering purchases
After writing down the necessary information you can hit a button labeled "Register purchases," your inputs will then be validated. If all inputs are valid they will get registered and shown at the bottom of the page.

## Removing purchases
Another button labeled "Remove purchases" will clear the bottom part of the page of all purchases.

## Removing singular purchases
Each registered and shown purchase will be assigned a button labeled "Delete" and if the button is clicked the purchase gets removed

## Editing purchases
Each registered and show purchase will also be assigned a button labeled "Edit" if the button is clicked input fields connected to the purchase will appear as well as a button labaled "Update". You can then edit the input fields and update the purchase if your inputs are valid
